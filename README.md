# Gulp Tutorial Notes
* From [CSS-Tricks.Com] - Full Gulp Tutorial With Examples

## Gulp Is Great For Manipulating Multiple Files At Once
* Multiple files of the same type (Called 'Globbing' - Essentially Just Regular Expressions For Filenames)
** [*.scss] - any file with .scss extension in this directory
** [**/*.scss] - any file with '.scss' in this or any root/child directories
** [!<some-name>.scss] - exclude <some-name>.scss from the search
** [*.+(scss|sass) - '+' & '|' allow us to match multiple patterns

* Preprocessing (SASS, PUG, etc.) & Compiling Into CSS/HTML
** Creating new files from those preprocessed files.

* Watching For Changes in Files And Updating Them.
